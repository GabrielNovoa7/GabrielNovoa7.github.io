      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Gabriel Novoa, and I’m a Computer Science major at the
        University of Houston–Downtown. I’m passionate about technology, learning new skills, 
        and building real-world projects that reflect what I’ve learned. Over the past few 
        semesters, I’ve gained experience in Python and C++, and I’ve worked on projects such 
        as an Employee Absence Management System, a resume website, and im working on 
        a weather-based web app.
        <br>
        Aside from backend logic and programming, 
        I’ve also started diving into frontend development using HTML and CSS — this website 
        is one of the first I’ve built from scratch! I love being hands-on with my learning, 
        whether it’s creating console-based apps in C++ or using APIs to build interactive 
        web pages. I’m always looking to grow and expand my skill set, and I’m 
        excited about where my journey in tech will take me.
        <br>
        Outside of academics, I’m into gaming, anime, fitness, and financial literacy. 
        I’m currently exploring areas like software development, cybersecurity, 
        and UI/UX Web Design. My goal is to find a career where I can be creative, solve problems, 
        and make a butt-load of money — without being stuck at a desk fixing 
        someone else’s broken code all day!
      </p>

          I created an employee absence management system. This project idea was 
          influenced by my mom who works as a high school secretary for the Houston 
          Independent School District. If you want more information
